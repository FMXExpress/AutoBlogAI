Built with [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/) using the FireMonkey framework this client works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (and maybe Android+iOS) with a single codebase and single UI. At the moment it is specifically set up for Windows.

It features a REST integration with Replicate.com and OpenAI for providing generative text functionality within the client. You need to sign up for an API keys to access that functionality.
